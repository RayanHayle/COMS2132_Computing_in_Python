# ðŸ“Š Economic Signal Detection & Consumer Behavior Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores how multiple economic indicators interact over time to reveal patterns in growth and recession. By analyzing five real-world datasets, it simulates the decision-making context for both institutions and consumersâ€”capturing macro signals, spending trends, loan activity, and investment behavior.

## Data Sources
- `unemployment_rate.csv`
- `bank-investment.csv`
- `consumer_spending.csv`
- `loan_payments.csv`
- `housing_prices.csv`

## Core Insights

- **Economic State Classification**  
  Categorized time periods as Growth, Recession, or Neutral using shifts in unemployment and spending.

- **Consumer Spending Trends**  
  Mapped changes in spending behavior during economic shifts to understand demand-side trends.

- **Loan Payment Sensitivity**  
  Analyzed patterns in loan repayments to infer financial stress and behavioral adaptation.

- **Housing Market Movements**  
  Tracked housing price trends as a leading/lagging indicator of economic momentum.

- **Bank Investment Behavior**  
  Evaluated institutional investment patterns in response to macroeconomic changes.
